	Need 'Parametric Lego Brick' module by John St√§ck which uses work by Andrew Sweet
		To use: put lego.scad in your OpenSCAD libraries folder
		(location varies with OS, but on a Mac it's ~/Documents/OpenSCAD/libraries/)

	translate ([20,0,0]) rotate ([-20,20,90*i])

		cols=2,       //Number of pegs in Y direction
		height=1,     //Normal bricks are 1, "low bricks" are 1/3
		brickScale=1, //Sizing factor. Use powers of 2 for compatibility
		pegs=true,    //If pegs on top are to be included
		fn=72         //"Curve fidelity", used as $fn for cylinders
